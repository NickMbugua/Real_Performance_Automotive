                    <p>The floor is only about .030" thick at the point the captured nuts are attached, so when the
                        shoes get worn, and people start stressing the mounts pulling the lever hard enough to get the
                        brake to hold, eventually you get the above condition... </p>
                    <p> The quickest and most effective fix is to build some patch plates (preferably slightly thicker
                        than the factory floor) and weld them in. As seen in the below two pics, I've cut out a plate,
                        welded a nut to it, drilled four holes in the corners to facilitate plug welds, then shaped it
                        to fit...</p>

                    <p>Plug welds are usually easiest to do with a MIG, but being as I didn't want to disassemble the
                        interior, and I certainly didn't want to start it on fire, I opted to do the job with a TIG so
                        that I could control the heat, and not have sparks flying around an unprotected interior. That
                        strategy comes with it's own problems, not the least of which my being far from an expert with a
                        TIG... Laying on the floorboard, operating the pedal with my left knee was stretching my
                        abilities slightly. Getting the fender cover that was padding my right knee stuck in the pedal
                        so the torch wouldn't turn off was fun.... Also TIG requires the work be extremely clean, and
                        any contamination quickly turns things ugly...</p>

                    <h3>Fixing the "our fuel pumps don't prime" dilemma</h3>
                    <p>While a non-issue for someone with a well sealed stock fuel system, it's a constant topic of
                        conversation for people that have switched to aftermarket regulators that tend to leak down...
                    </p>

                    <p>This fix is very easy to do, cheap, and works awesome... I originally came up with it trying to
                        solve the same issue on an older carbureted vehicle that would have an empty carb after sitting
                        for a week or more. Realized the same concept would be perfect in our cars.</p>

                    <p>If you have a hot wired pump, and some electronic imagination, you could do this with a little
                        less complexity, but the method I'm outlining here can easily be copied, and it doesn't care if
                        you are running a stock pump or hotwired, as long as you are using the stock system to turn it
                        on... It is also pretty non-intrusive, as it pretty much leaves the stock system in place, and
                        piggy backs onto it. Just make sure you use a relay and pigtail that is compatible with the load
                        it will be carrying.</p>

                    <p>It all hinges around a five pin Bosch style relay, and this very cool little piece of modern
                        electronics:</p>
                    <a href="http://www.3rdbrakeflasher.com/timer...amp-p-192.html" class="relay-link">Multi-Functional
                        5V-20V Time Delay Relay</a>
                    <p>They sell them on Amazon and ebay as well. So they shouldn't be hard to find.</p>

                    <p> First step is to set up your timer. I won't go into the instructions on how to do that, as the
                        manufacturer has that covered, but you do want to configure it to turn on for a short time when
                        powered up, then turn off. (I use 5 seconds, but you can set it up any way you like) Once the
                        timer is configured, I snip the unused trigger wire back and wrap it to the ground wire, then
                        snip the two configuration wires back at slightly different lengths, and wrap them to the output
                        wire:</p>
                    <img src="img/repair2-1.JPG" alt="Image of a wire connector">
                    <p>Once you have a neat little three wire device ready to install, you want to 'T' the power in (red
                        wire) to pin 87 of your relay harness, 'T' the black ground wire into the pin 85 wire of your
                        harness, and run the yellow output to pin 86 of your relay. (ignore the fact that 87/87a are
                        reversed in the below pic, I moved it later)</p>
                    <img src="img/repair2-2.JPG" alt="Image of a wire repair">
                    <p>Now you have a timed relay ready to install... I little electrical tape to tie everything
                        together and you're ready to start putting it in the car:</p>
                    <img src="img/repair2-3.JPG" alt="Image of a wire connector repair">
                    <p>You're going to install this in the harness at the MPFI. You are going to 'T' the power in wire
                        (Pin 87 of your relay) into the black/white ignition source. You are going to snip the
                        black/blue wire to the fuel pump, and run the MPFI side to pin 87a of your relay, and the fuel
                        pump side to pin 30. You then ground pin 85 of your relay, and you're done...</p>
                    <img src="img/repair2-4.JPG" alt="Image of a wire connector repair">
                    <p>The hardest part is finding a home to mount the relay... On a late model with the separated MPFI,
                        I was able to just rotate them back and use the free mounting screw. On an early one with the
                        large single MPFI relay you're on your own as I haven't done one yet:</p>

                <article class="blog_article" id="Camlock-thread">
                    <h3> Camlock thread</h3>
                    <p>There has been much discussion over the years about the benefits of camlockers when working on
                        our motors... Many won't do the job without them, others say: "real men don't need no @$#%ing
                        camlocks!"

                        Personally I think they make the job harder than it has to be... When working on cars for a
                        living, time is money. Trying to nail the tension on the belt first try with lockers in the way
                        just turns into a PITA.

                        But then there's that front cam that always wants to take off... If you're careful, and take
                        your time, you can certainly keep it in check. But if you're trying to get things done, (the
                        time is money thing again...) and you do more than one every 60K you drive your car, it's only a
                        matter of time before it gets away from you. Now most would say "No big deal, just put it
                        back...", which is a reasonable enough theory... What is not considered is Murphy's law, which
                        requires it to take off while you have an appendage in close proximity, turning the front gear
                        into a surprisingly effective meat saw.

                        Since time is money, and it takes time to stop the job, clean the flesh out of the gear, and
                        hose the blood off of your customer's car, it would seem like a time saver to have something in
                        place to prevent such an occurrence:</p>

                    <p>In case anyone is wondering, That's just a spare 8mm bolt with a short chunk of 5/16" fuel line
                        shoved over it... You can simply screw it in by hand, it only takes a couple seconds in and out.

                    <h3>Tensioner fix</h3>
                    <p>For all of you who lose sleep at night worrying about losing a tensioner, or those of you who
                        throw away a perfectly good tensioner for fear of reusing it even if it only has a few thousand
                        miles on it... Here's your ticket to happiness..</p>
                    <p>A 1/16" thick flat washer with a 1/4" hole, dropped over the shaft".</p>
                    <img src="img/repair4-1.JPG" alt="Image of a tensioner">
                    <p>Now you can install the tensioner in a normal manner, and it could completely fail, and the only
                        thing you'd have to worry about is diagnosing that funny knocking noise in the front of your
                        motor... It can fully retract and you won't have enough slack to let it jump.</p>
                    <p>Since I was taking pics for this I thought I'd also demonstrate just how much these things move
                        around as the engine warms up... If you've never observed it or thought about it, I think you'll
                        be amazed. (This is also why I won't run a solid tensioner)</p>

                <article class="blog_article">
                    <h3 id="vcu">Let's talk VCU...</h3>
                    <p>Of all the parts on these cars, the viscous coupler stands out as one of the most
                        misunderstood... Is it good, or is it bad? which one is it? how do you test it?</p>
                    <p>First lets work on how to identify the VCU:</p>
                    <p>There are two basic design housings; The first design has no thrust surface on either side of the
                        outer housing. The inner sleeve protrudes from both sides approx. 1/4". The second design has a
                        thrust surface built into the outer housing on the left side, so that the sleeve is flush with
                        the housing. In the vast majority of cases, the first design will be an 18 spline unit, and the
                        second design will be a 25 spline unit. (but don't bet the farm on that, because there are some
                        second design 18 spline units floating around)</p>
                    <img src="img/repair5-1.JPG" alt="Image of a VCU">
                    <p>The primary difference between the two, is that the 18 spline unit has the splines biased toward
                        the left side, with splines all the way to the end of the sleeve. The 25 spline unit has the
                        splines centered in the sleeve. You cannot physically put an 18 spline unit in a 25 spline
                        trans, but care must be taken not to mix them up and put a 25 spline unit in an 18 spline
                        trans.(It will fit in place, but only give you about 1/4" spline engagement to the front diff.)
                    </p>
                    <p>The following three pics, combined with the previous one, show the differences in the output, sun
                        gear and VCU inner sleeve:</p>

                    <p>So now we know how to identify it, how do we tell if it's any good..?</p>
                    <p>The first thing to check is the splines... Excess wear is bad:</p>

                    <p>Then if you're working on an 18 spline unit, you want to check for excess end clearance. they
                        have a habit of walking the inner sleeve right through the housing. (this is where we find out
                        WHY they re-designed it)</p>
                    <img src="img/repair5-6.JPG" alt="Image of a VCU">
                    <p>I have a preventative fix for that particular problem:</p>
                    <img src="img/repair5-7.JPG" alt="Image of a VCU"> <br>
                    <img src="img/repair5-8.JPG" alt="Image of a VCU">
                    <p>The next thing you want to check is find out if it's obviously blown. (we'll do a more
                        comprehensive test shortly if it's not obviously junk) Just grab the sun gear, and try to spin
                        the center by hand. If you can easily spin it, we're done, it's now a core to be sent back to
                        your favorite vendor when you buy your rebuilt one...</p>
                    <p>If you can't turn it by hand, or can barely turn it slowly, we can move on: The next thing we
                        want to check is the seals. The only thing you can check here, is visually look for signs of
                        leakage, and check the grip of the rubber on the inner sleeve. The seals are a large O-ring that
                        when in good condition have significant preload on the seal surface. You check that grip by
                        working the endplay of the inner sleeve back and forth. If it easily rattles around, the seals
                        are most likely hard as rock, and you run the risk of puking the viscous fluid the first time
                        you get it hot. If they show a good resistance to movement then you have a good chance of them
                        continuing to do their job...</p>
                    <p>So now we get to the meat of the issue.... How do we test one to find out if it's any good? what
                        is good, what is bad? I may disappoint some of you here, I have no intention of telling you
                        where that line is. What I am going to do, is show you how a new unit behaves, and hopefully
                        give you the information you need to make that decision for yourself.</p>
                    <p>A while back I bought a brand new 18 spline unit, it's never been dipped in gear oil... So I
                        figured it would be the perfect test subject. I stuck it in a vise, and broke out the torque
                        wrenches.</p>
                    <p>The VCU's job is not to stop movement, but to stop RAPID movement... So the first thing I checked
                        is the actual breakaway torque. I found that at a very slow movement, it took a pretty low 15
                        ft/lbs to maintain movement. At that pace, it would take well over a full minute to make one
                        revolution. Next I checked the rapid movement torque limiting. This is a bit subjective to how
                        much of a gorilla the guy pulling the torque wrench is, but I found that I could pop 85 ft/lbs
                        with a hard fast pull.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to get this on video, but it didn't work out as well as I wanted. I only had my phone,
                        and nobody to help me, so they aren't much... The low torque one I pushed the button to turn it
                        off at the end and it kept recording for a couple seconds until I caught it, so you get to look
                        at the floor for a bit..The high torque one just suffers from me trying to hold the phone with
                        one hand, and pop 85 ft/lbs with the other...</p>

                    <h3>2006 Buick Rendezvous transmission issues</h3>
                    <p>A few times a year, on nearly every car forum I’m on, someone will post a thread asking about what it’s like to be an auto technician… The following tale of woe is one that many experienced techs will know all too well. But for those that are thinking of doing this for a living, take heed, this is your future…</p>
                    <p>You will find out what a tech is really made of not by how many hours he flags, or how many certs he has on his arm, or what amazing feat of diagnostic skill he can claim. No, you’ll find out what he’s made of when he f*#ks up… How you compose yourself, how you handle it, and how you deal with the stress, will make or break you. And make no mistake, you WILL screw up sooner or later. What nobody ever expects though, is the snowball effect… Call it Murphy’s law, bad luck, blame it on anything you want, If a car starts in on you, it’s going to push you to the limit of sanity, then it’s going to give you that little shove to see if you go over the edge. If you don’t fall, if you somehow resist the temptation to crawl into the bottom drawer of your toolbox in the fetal position until they haul you off in a rubber lined truck, congratulations! You’re a real auto tech now…</p>
                    <p>My tale begins with a 2006 Buick Rendezvous AWD, 64K on the clock, complaint of trans issues. It was cutting loose and chattering in low gear, and spinning up on the 1-2 shift. I suspected the all too common pressure control solenoid failure, so I hooked up the pressure gauge and went for a drive. I was able to confirm some pressure control problems, and condemned the solenoid, but also noticed that there were problems even when the pressure was high. So the customer was advised that there was internal damage, and the unit had to come out</p>
                    <p>Now this is not an easy unit to remove and install… It requires removal of the driveline, exhaust, and steering rack, then hang the engine, and remove the entire subframe, remove the axles, then pull the trans and transfer case as an assembly, and split them once it’s out. By the time you have it out, it looks like you’ve detonated a small nuclear device on the floor…</p>
                    <p>I found pretty much what I expected, fried input clutches from low pressure, so I proceeded to replace the bad clutches, install a shift kit, and replace the pressure control solenoid. I also found what I felt was a ridiculous amount of clearance in the forward servo, and shimmed it out a bit to reduce the clearance. (first screw up…) So I stacked everything up, air checked the assemblies, made sure all the clutches and servos applied with air pressure, heard a little air leakage, but it didn’t sound like it was any more than some typical sealing ring leakage, the clutches all applied fine.</p>
                    <p>Got all back together, and found out that I had misjudged the travel of the forward servo when I shimmed it, and it was able to stroke far enough to allow the shim to fall out of it’s cavity and bind the piston… Now on any other 4T65E, I’d just pull the servo cover from the side of the trans, and fix the problem. Not this one… The AWD transfer case is on top of the cover, and you have to pull the trans to remove the T/case. So back out it comes. Got that fixed, put it back in, and went for a test drive… Trans is working fine, all is well (for a little while…). As it got hot, and I started pushing it harder, I suddenly had a cutloose chatter in low, and a spinup on the 1-2… Gee, this sounds familiar doesn’t it…? So once again the trans hits the floor. I had obviously not found a very root cause of the original symptoms. I scattered the trans, and began the search, didn’t find anything obvious, so I started air checking individual drums looking for leaks. I ended up finding a crack in the input drum that was leaking off apply pressure to the input clutch. OK, it’s been out three times, that sucks, but at least I found the problem… Order parts, put it back together tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>So that brings us to this morning… Got the part, put it together, air checked it, all is well. So back together the trans goes.</p>
                    <p>Now this deep in is where you have to be really careful, you’re tired of working on this thing, you want it to go away so badly, you’re stressed out because the fiasco you’ve created is costing the shop boatloads of money, you’re afraid your starting to look like a buck-toothed moron to the customer who has no concept of what you’re dealing with... So you get in a hurry to get the thing out of your life, and end up f*#king something else up… In my case, I bolted the side cover on without connecting the manual link to the valve.</p>
                    <p>It was after 3:00pm when I got it all back together and discovered it wouldn’t shift into gear… Hmmm, bottom drawer of the box, fetal position, rubber lined truck? All sounding pretty good right now… But no, I dove into dropping the driver’s side of the subframe down, pulled the Axle and trans mount, pulled the side cover off in the car, and re-connected the link. Of course it couldn’t go that smoothly, something had to go wrong just to let me know the day wasn’t over yet… When I dropped the subframe down, the steering shaft didn’t pull off the end of the rack, and ended up pulling the spline apart. Yay… I get to go crawl under the dash and pull the other half out, and try to re-assemble the thing… So I got that all handled, it’s all back together, fluid in it, and I take it out for a drive.</p>
                    <p>The trans works great, took it on an extended test drive, made sure it was all better…</p>
                    <p>Remember what I said about that last little push to test you…? I’m driving this thing down the road on the final test drive, and realize the steering wheel isn’t straight. How the F*&^K did I get the steering shaft off a tooth….? So back in the shop it goes, burrow back under the dash, yank the steering shaft out, re-clock it, and put it back in…</p>
                    <p>6:30pm, the car has run out of ways to ruin my day, it’s done, and I go home…</p>
                    <p>The bright side..? I opted to write this tale in favor of getting really friendly with a bottle of Crown Royal, and tomorrow’s task of fixing the broken exhaust studs on the 460 powered E350, (formerly considered one of the most horrid jobs known to man) is going to be a comparative walk in the park…</p>
                    <p>Any guesses why I started calling the thing “the groundhog”?</p>
